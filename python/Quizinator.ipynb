Today I'm here in Bucharest, Romania, attending the EGM, the Erasmus Generation Meeting, where more than 800 people from all around Europe who are part of the Erasmus Student Network gather to have discussions, workshops, sessions in order to shape the future of Europe. For every question that they answer correctly, they win 20 euros. Let's see who's gonna win some money. What's your name? Eiberk. Where are you from? Turkey. Name three countries that have the same four last letters. Spain. The Netherlands. No, no, no. Same that end with the same four last letters. Bulgaria. Slovakia. Slovenia. No, it's A. No, no, no. With the same four last letters. Oh my god. Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan. There you go. Four countries that end with Stan. Yeah, and? That's it. Three countries. Yeah, good job. Thank you so much. What's your name? I'm Raul. Which country are you from? Netherlands. Name four capitals worldwide that have four letters. That's hard one. Can I have another question? No. Oh, f***. Delhi. New Delhi. Yeah, true. And Delhi itself has five letters. Oh, with the H, yeah. F***, this is harder than I thought. Yeah. Well, you watch it on TikTok. It's not gonna give you 10 more seconds. Yeah, f*** it. Rome, Lima, Doha. What's your name? I'm Kai. Where are you from? I live in the Netherlands, but I'm from Japan. And you're part of which ESN section? I am from ESN 20. On which continent is the youngest country in the world? I would say Asia. He's wrong. I'm sorry. Oh, where is it? It's in Africa. It's in Africa. Which country? South Sudan. Okay, that's right. That makes so much sense. What's your name? Anika. Where are you from? I'm from Amsterdam. Which section? Demon. Demon, okay. I'm from Amsterdam. Okay, fair enough. Name three out of four capitals of the UK. London. That's right. I think this is where it comes to an end. Really? No idea of Scotland. Oh, wait, Dublin. Oh, no, Dublin is Ireland. Edinburgh. That is correct. One more. I don't know the one of Wales. Or Northern Ireland. No idea. Sorry. Would have been either Cardiff or Belfast. Sorry. Fair enough. Thanks for playing with us. What's your name? Pannos. Where are you from? I'm from Greece. And which ESN section? ESN Athens AUB. Nice. Which continent is the driest one in the world? Oh, Australia. No, that's wrong. I'm so sorry. Yeah, it's Antarctic because all the water is frozen. So it doesn't count as water. Really? It is actually, yeah, that's it. Okay. What's your name? My name is Myli. Where are you from? I'm from the Netherlands. Which section? We're from Agnia. Plus minus three. How many countries worldwide speak Spanish as their official language? I think 21.
